## Hey there! 

I’m Jardel — a data nerd at heart with 14+ years working in data and 7+ years focused on data governance. I love helping companies make sense of their data, build solid foundations, and actually use their data to make better decisions.

Over the years, I’ve led amazing teams, built cloud-based data lakes, automated pipelines, and rolled out governance programs that stick. I’ve worked with tools like Airflow, DBT, OpenMetadata, and Power BI, and I’m big on keeping things secure, compliant, and aligned with business goals (think DAMA, NIST, LGPD, and more).

I’m also passionate about creating a data-driven culture — from running workshops to collaborating across teams and turning complex problems into clear, actionable plans.

If you’re into data, governance, tech leadership, or just want to swap stories about how to make messy data work better, let’s connect!
